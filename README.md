## Description
The Weather Dashboard is a web application that allows users to view current and 5-day weather forecasts for multiple cities. It is built using TypeScript, Express, and the OpenWeather API, providing real-time weather data. Users can search for a city to get temperature, wind speed, and humidity details, along with an icon representation of the weather conditions. The app also maintains a search history for easy access to previously searched cities, with options to delete entries.
